## Theoretical Framework for Urban Livability Index

### Introduction to Urban Livability

Urban livability is the ability of urban spaces to fulfill the expectations of its inhabitants for wellbeing and quality of life (Martino, Girling and Lu, 2021). Urban livability is a very important concept in today's world as the cities all over the world experience massive growth and urbanization. Today, 55% of the world's population lives in urban areas, and the number is expected to increase to 68% by 2050 (United Nations, 2018). Information on what makes cities livable is crucial for a number of things including: urban planning, making a decision about where to live and work and more.

### Justification for This Index

Urban Livability Index can be useful for a few different things such as:

1.  **Different Factors**: This index is derived from 17 different metrics under 4 different categories: economic livability, infrastructure and connectivity, quality of life and social and inclusivity factors.
2.  **Policy Development**: Governments and city/urban planners use evidence based insights to prioritize developments through out the cities to allocate resources effectively. As mentioned on _Liveability_ (2020), indicators such as housing affordability etc. are linked to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.
3.  **Decision Support**: People considering relocating for work, education or for other reasons would benefit from a comprehensive data to consider different options or make better claims for their choices. Indexes like these can provide a consistent framework for assessing the strengths and weaknesses of urban economies (Global Cities Index, 2024).

### Appropriateness of the Dataset

The dataset is appropriate due to a few reasons:

1.  **Good Metrics**: The 17 metrics found in this dataset cover a good spectrum of urban life from basic needs (housing and healthcare) to quality of life factors (leisure & culture, outdoors) and economic opportunities (startups, venture capital).
2.  **Balanced**: The metrics have a good balance between objective measures (internet access, commute times) and more subjective elements (tolerance, environmental quality) that might give good insights on the livability. 
3.  **Global**: The dataset includes data from all over the world including multiple continents which allows global comparisons while maintaining sensitivity to regional differences.

### Sub Index Structure

The composite index will be organized into the following sub-indices:

1.  **Basic Needs Index**
    -   Housing
    -   Healthcare
    -   Safety
    -   Environmental Quality
2.  **Economic Opportunity Index**
    -   Economy
    -   Startups
    -   Venture Capital
    -   Business Freedom
    -   Taxation
3.  **Mobility & Infrastructure Index**
    -   Travel Connectivity
    -   Commute
    -   Internet Access
4.  **Quality of Life Index**
    -   Leisure & Culture
    -   Education
    -   Tolerance
    -   Outdoors
    -   Cost of Living
